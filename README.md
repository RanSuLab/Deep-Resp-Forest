# Introduction
ccle_gcForest plays the code for ccle<br>
cgp_gcForest plays the code for cgp<br>
the `ccle_four.py` is the code for MIMGS 1<br>
the `ccle_gcForest.py` is the code for MIMGS 2<br>
the `cgp_four.py` is the code for MIMGS 1<br>
the `cgp_gcForest.py` is the code for MIMGS 2<br>
We plays some other code files(svm, rf, gene, cna...) in those dirs for reference<br>
*****The GCForest code we used is from Pierre-Yves Lablanche.<br>

*****Python3 implementation of the gcForest algorithm preesented in Zhou and Feng 2017<br>
*****(paper can be found here : https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835 ).<br>
# Python:3.6
# Use:
You need to download the gene expression files of ccle and cgp from the website<br>
and rename those files to "gene.txt"<br>
Then you need to put them into the corresponding dirs.<br>
Then you can run our program. <br>
