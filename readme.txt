##### Introduction
ccle_gcForest plays the code for ccle
cgp_gcForest plays the code for cgp
the ccle_four.py is the code for MIMGS 1
the ccle_gcForest.py is the code for MIMGS 2
the cgp_four.py is the code for MIMGS 1
the cgp_gcForest.py is the code for MIMGS 2
We plays some other code files(svm,rf,gene,cna...) in those dirs for reference
*****The GCForest code we used is from Pierre-Yves Lablanche.

*****Python3 implementation of the gcForest algorithm preesented in Zhou and Feng 2017
*****(paper can be found here : https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08835 ).
##### Python:3.6
##### Use:
You need to download the gene exprssion files of ccle and cgp from the website
and rename those files to "gene.txt"
Then you need to put them into the corresponding dirs.
Then you can run our program.
